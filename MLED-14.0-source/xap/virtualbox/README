VirtualBox Open Source Edition (OSE) is a general-purpose full
virtualizer for x86 hardware.

By default VirtualBox will be compiled with hardening enabled. That
means all binaries will be run suid root, which is the default
behaviour of upstream packages. However, you are still able
to disable this by passing HARDENING=no to the script.

You have to create a vboxusers group, e.g. "groupadd -g 215 vboxusers"
and make your user a member of that group.

To compile virtualbox without the Qt4 GUI pass QT4=no to the script.

To enable the webservice pass WEBSERVICE=yes to the script. This adds gsoap
to the list of required dependencies.

If you want to attach VirtualBox to a VDE network you will need vde2.

VirtualBox requires acpica, the jdk package from /extra, and the
virtualbox-kernel package is needed at runtime. See README.SLACKWARE
for some setup notes.

NOTE: This will not build on a stock x86_64 system.
